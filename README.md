The main goal of the course is to provide a sufficient level of comfort in working with Kubernetes and to help build knowledge and skills for both working with containerized applications deployed in Kubernetes and managing Kubernetes clusters themselves. Additionally, participants will learn how to build and manage small Kubernetes clusters, how to monitor and troubleshoot them using various techniques and tools, and more. These skills will be achieved by laying solid and detailed theoretical foundations, which will be complemented by practical exercises and tasks. What is learned during the course can serve both as preparation for certification and be directly applied in practice.
