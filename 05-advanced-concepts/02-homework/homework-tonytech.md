# Tasks
Try to solve the following set of tasks:
### 1.	Init Containers
#### a.	Create a set of two init containers and one app container (in fact modify/extend the example shown during the practice)
#### b.	The first init container should generate the following two lines with 10 seconds delay
dd-mm-yyyy hh:mi:ss => begin initialization …
dd-mm-yyyy hh:mi:ss => … done
Please note that the dd-mm-yyyy hh:mi:ss should reflect the actual time the event is taking place
#### c.	The second init container should add one more line like the following
dd-mm-yyyy hh:mi:ss => launching the application …
Please note that the dd-mm-yyyy hh:mi:ss should reflect the actual time the event is taking place
#### d.	The app container should be nginx based and should display the three lines generated by the init containers instead of the default index page
### 2.	Ingress and TLS
#### a.	Using either NGINX or HAProxy (the implementation should not differ significantly) ingress controller try to modify/extend the fan out example shown in the practice to handle TLS traffic
#### b.	Note, that you will need to create a self-signed certificate and store it in a secret which then to be used in the ingress
### 3.	Another Ingress Controller
#### a.	Repeat the fan out example shown in the practice but with another ingress controller of your choice (not NGINX or HAProxy)
